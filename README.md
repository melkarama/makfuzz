## 🚀 What is MakFuzz?

**MakFuzz** is a powerful, desktop-based fuzzy search utility designed to find needles in haystacks. Whether you are deduplicating customer records, matching messy implementation lists, or just trying to find "John Smith" in a list of "Jon Smythes", MakFuzz has your back!

It goes beyond simple string matching by combining **Spelling Similarity** (how it looks) with **Phonetic Similarity** (how it sounds) to give you the most accurate matches possible. 🎧🔡

## ✨ Key Features

### 🧠 Dual-Core Engine
- **Spelling Strategy**: Utilizing `Jaro-Winkler` distance to catch typos and visual similarities.
- **Phonetic Strategy**: Powered by `Beider-Morse` and `Double Metaphone`, it understands how names *sound* across different languages (French, English, Generic).

### 🎛️ Granular Control
- **Weighted Criteria**: Is the *Last Name* more important than the *First Name*? You decide! assigns weights (e.g., 60/40) to drive your scoring logic.
- **Strict Threshods**: Set minimum quality bars. E.g., "Must be at least 80% phonetically similar to even be considered."

### 📊 Rich Analytics
- **Live Dashboard**: See real-time breakdown of scores:
  - `S%` (Spelling Score)
  - `P%` (Phonetic Score)
  - `Total Score` (Weighted Average)
- **Deep Dive Stats**: The footer isn't just a footer—it's a data goldmine showing:
  - **Max Under Threshold**: The best match that *didn't* make the cut (your "near misses").
  - **Min Above Threshold**: The worst match that *did* make the cut.
  - **Total**: Instant count of all findings.

### 💾 Smart Persistence
- **Auto-Save**: Closing the app? No stress! MakFuzz saves your entire workspace (paths, weights, thresholds) to `~/.makfuzz_config.xml` automatically. It’s ready exactly as you left it next time. 🔄

### 📤 Export Power
- **CSV & Excel**: One-click export of your filtered results to standard formats.
